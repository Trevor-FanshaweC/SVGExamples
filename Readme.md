# SVG examples 
I have created an examle that uses SVG in 2 (and a half) ways. This doesn't replace the class examples - i didn't do any of the CSS stuff in these, just JavaScript. You can combine these examples with your class files to complete the homework.

One edit - an object tag needs this in the "type" attribute: <code>type="image/svg+xml"</code>  
The class files have text/svg... this isn't right. You'll need to update your class files wherever you're using an object tag. It's not critical / won't break anything, but you should update your files regardless.
